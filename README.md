#### The maxProfit function returns the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock at the given price and then selling the stock later on. 
#### For example if the input is: [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11] then your program should return 16 because if you bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16 was made and this is the largest profit that could be made.
